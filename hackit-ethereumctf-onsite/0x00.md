Disassemble opcodes to get hidden fields like username and password. I leave for reader as an exercise :P
```
await contract.run()
"Contract has some methods. Go to info() method"
await contract.info()
"There is a station contract. For more details read the message()"
await contract.message()
"Who is the hero of this game? Use checkTheName() method with appropriate param"
await contract.checkTheName("elliot")
"Good. Now, try to getAccess() for advanced station settings. If you know the param for this method..Carefully examine the contract"
await contract.getAccess("mrrobot312")
await contract.suspicious()
"mrrobot312"
```
