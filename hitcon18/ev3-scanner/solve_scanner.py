Instruction opInput_Device (CMD, â€¦) 
Opcode 0x99
Now here we are looking at the read values from the sensor sent from ev3 to localhost ethernet
It seems like # for black and <space> for white will recreate the image
Example payload:  99 1d 00 02 00 02 01 60
length = 8 Bytes
99 = Opcode
1d = READY_SI 
00 = Layer number 0
02 = Port Number of Sensor
00 = Type (default)
02 = Mode (default)
01 = Returned values (eh?)
Seems this payload is send as a request to read the values from sensor I think and the ev3 will respond it.
Hence, the communication weill be from LegoSyst -> localhost ethernet this case as values taken from robot will be sent of.
The response data variantions are minute :
00 c0 80 
00 80 3f
+   +  45       (1st + is faster, 2nd is increment)
00 c0 80
00 80 3f
-  -  45
00 c0 40
00 80 3f
+   +  45     (1st + is faster, 2nd is increment)
This looks like the  ++45 means robot is making 180 degree U-Turn towards Right hand side
- - 45 is to nullify I think, making 180 degree U-Turn towards Left hand side
and c0 80 , c0 40 means White color read
80 3f means black color read
>>> int('c0', 16), int('80',16)
(192, 128)
>>> int('80', 16), int('3f',16)
(128, 63)
So, if the color is black then seems sensor value will be down 
----> 1
<----- 2
-------> 3
............
--------> 11
So, robot will traverse 11 times on the mattress.
