Abused LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE.
Worked on it late as there were lots of challenges, and less engagers -_-
Idea was to see config first, one thing stands out local-infile=TRUE & also table creation perms and write provided
Double weirdness. After a lot of test, in fact there were 10-20 iterations of payload I tried. Some failed on remote, some worked on mysql cli , some failed on php -a
Unsure weather there is mysqli.allow_local_infile = On is enabled on server, but looks like it is!
Wasn't sure but tried, blind, basic sleep worked. with exfil. Read up documentation then.
Then blind time based extraction it is.

use mysql;
create temporary table megatmp.temps (id text);
load data local infile '/flag' into table megatmp.temps (@rip) set id = sleep(length(@rip));

flag{enterprise_mysql_servers_are_glorified_file_hosting_server}

script on vps, rip me vps thrashed after ctf. Unfortunately, got flag after 3 mins of end. smh. Was halfway when ctf end :oof:
prolly, after script while build a proper writeup on this.
